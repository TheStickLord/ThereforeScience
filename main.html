        Therefore Science initially started as a simple mining company, then
        under the name Patty's Mining Co. Despite our humble roots, Therefore
        Science has been innovating since the beginning. The first patent
        developed by Patty's Mining Co. was a pizza holding device. This device
        was the groundwork for our Science division, which was founded due to
        the success of Patty's Pizza Holder.
      </h1>
      <h1 class="miniH1 DivFont">
        Since then, we’ve hit the ground running, developing new technology,
        such as our advanced mining equipment, our FLOOD network, and FLOOD
        communications devices.
